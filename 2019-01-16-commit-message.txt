Update 1PPS Second Labels in MEDM summary screens

The 1PPS Summary screens, accessible at the bottom of the Timing overview
MEDM screen (SYS_CUST_TIMING.adl), had incorrect descriptions for the
1PPS timing diagnostic signals. The following screens under the summary
button have been fixed:

MSR Comparator/Frequency Counter
CER Comparator/Frequency Counter 
EX Comparator/Frequency Counter 
EY Comparator/Frequency Counter 
--This line, and those below, will be ignored--
